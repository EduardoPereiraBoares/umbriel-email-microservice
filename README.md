# 📖 Introduction<br>

This repository is my first email microservice in Node.JS, developed with the intention of practicing basic concepts of TypeScript and tests with Jest and studying micro services and message queues with Redis.<br><br>


# 🌐 Technologies<br>

<h3>Node.JS</h3>
Node.js is an open source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js runs the JavaScript V8 engine, the core of Google Chrome, for the browser. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux. Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.

<h3>Typescript</h3>
TypeScript is a superset of the JavaScript language that has a single open-source compiler and is developed mainly by a single vendor: Microsoft. The goal of TypeScript is to help catch mistakes early through a type system and to make JavaScript development more efficient.

<h3>MongoDB<h3>
MongoDB is a distributed database, based on documents and general purpose, developed for developers of modern applications and to be used in the cloud.<br>

# 📚 Principal libraries<br>

<h3>Express</h3>
Express.js is a Node.js web application server framework, designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications. It is the de facto standard server framework for node.js.

<h3>Nodemon</h3>
Nodemon is a device that monitors any changes in its source and automatically restarts the server. Perfect for development.

<h3>Mongoose</h3>
It is a Nodejs library that offers a schema-based solution for modeling your application data. It has a type conversion system, validation, creation of queries and hooks for business logic. This means that Mongoose translates the database data into JavaScript objects for use by your application.

<h3>Jest</h3>
Jest is a powerful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

<h3>ESLint</h3>
ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

<h3>Prettier</h3>
Prettier is an opinionated code formatter.

<h3>Cors</h3>
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources.<br>
